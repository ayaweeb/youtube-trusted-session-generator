# YouTube trusted session generator

## Description

This script will output two parameters: po_token and visitor_data. Needed for passing YouTube checks in Invidious or the program that use the po_token functionality.

## What's po_token

po_token known as Proof of Origin Token. This is an attestation token generated by a complex anti robot verification system created by Google named BotGuard/DroidGuard. It is used to confirm that the request is coming from a genuine device.
    
These identity tokens (po_token and visitor_data) generated using this tool will make your entire YouTube session more easily traceable by YouTube because it is tied to a unique identifier.

## Requirement(s)

- You have to run this command on the same public IP address as the one blocked by YouTube. Not necessarily the same machine, just the same public IP address.  
  Subsequent usage of this same token will work on the same IP range or even the same ASN. The point is to generate this token on a blocked IP as "unblocked" IP addresses seems to not generate a token valid for passing the checks on a blocked IP.  


### Usage of the HTTP API

Send your requests to http://localhost:8080/token in order to obtain your po_token.

You can also force refresh the po_token in the cache by sending a request to http://localhost:8080/update.
